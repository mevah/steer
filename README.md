Voice Protocol done right.

## Inspiration
People go off topic during the meetings all the time. Your little story about two kitten in a basket easily wastes tens of working hours per meeting. This needs to end, Karen. We are claiming the time back!

## What it does
Our app "Steer" is a game changer. It monitors your meetings, as soon as you start drifting off, you're gonna get a friendly nudge. It will keep track of your agenda and keep ticking off the covered topics.

But wait...there's more!

Steer also provides the complete meeting minutes for you, in an easily digestible format. It does this, so you don't have to!

## How we built it
By conducting a thorough UX analysis with various stakeholders (as seen on the video). We then selected the best technologies for the job, while constantly keeping the focus on the users. Many sprints and running around were involved.

## Challenges we ran into
Integration with some APIs were not actually possible to lift the heavy weight for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We pulled it off, we managed to provide proof of concept that is valuable for the clients.

##Built With
java, javascript, node.js, python, torch (https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain)
