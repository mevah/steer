“text”: ["Hello everbody, let's start the meeting. Which workshop are you guys thinking about working on? I say we choose Huawei workshop since they provide a lot for us to kickstart our idea.", "Hi everyone, I am a computer scientist and I work on UX design. I am hyped to be working on this challenge. We should start by planning what we are going to do the next 48 hours.", "I am experienced in react native and everythin front end. How about we pitch an idea about a web app?", "Yes, that's what I was thinking. I think we can create an app that tracks what people are talking about, and then measures the similarity with a given topic. This way we can identify who are being on track with the meeting and actually making useful conversations.", "That's a great idea. We can also incorporate a scoring system, where we see who are being off topic and are making useless banter. We want shorter, more efficient meetings, since the pandemic left us a world with remote working. This means we are on the Zoom calls all the time, and the meetings are taking way longer than they should be sometimes.", "I agree. We probably need less people in the meetings as well. They are too many people that are doing nothing in a meeting.", I love Rick and Morty too. What do you think about the new season? I think Summer really improved from the last season. She has so much more independence over herself now. Also the arguments about feminism were just astonishing.”],
